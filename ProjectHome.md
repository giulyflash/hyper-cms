Attempt to create free, opensource, fast, simple and flexible web site creation system on PHP+MySQL+XSL. In future possible to use PHP-template and MongoDB, maybe Python instead PHP.

STRONGLY RECOMMENDED do not use (and even read) this code before release.

Future modules:
menu (popup, breadcrumbs);
article (with rss);
file (file store, photo-gallery);
user (with unix-like role system);
shop/ads (with integration to account-systems, like 1C);
helpdesk/servicedesk;
chat, blog/forum integration etc.
